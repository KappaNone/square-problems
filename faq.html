              <p>Intranet means a closed network that resides on a local network. An intranet acts like a website that only
               authorized users can access and is generally used by organizations who wish to share knowledge,
               internal communications, and information with their colleagues.

               <p>The main difference between an intranet and the internet is that the former is a closed network, and the latter is a public network. In short, the internet is for all; a company intranet is for a select group of people.

             <p>An intranet is a closed network designed to allow an organization to share information and corporate communication among its employees. An extranet is similar to an intranet, but allows third-party entry, so vendors or partners can experience full or selected access.

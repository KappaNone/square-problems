            <h3>What is an intranet?</h3>
       <p>Intranet means a closed network that resides on a local network. An intranet acts like a website that only
        authorized users can access and is generally used by organizations who wish to share knowledge,
        internal communications, and information with their colleagues.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between the internet and an intranet?</h3>
        <p>The main difference between an intranet and the internet is that the former is a closed network, and the latter is a public network. In short, the internet is for all; a company intranet is for a select group of people.</p>
